    <p class="P">My name is KC Lynn Service and I am 13 years old. I love to play guitar and I want to learn how to play piano. I love dogs and cats even though im allregic to cats, I still think that they're really cute. I like to consider myself an artist and I aspire one day to make a living off of what I make. When I grow up I want to be an artist and a video game developer.</p>
